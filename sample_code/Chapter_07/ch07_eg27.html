<div>If you want to create parts of pages that stretch and shrink to fit the size of users' screens, then the max-width and min-width properties are very useful because they allow you to create boxes that can change in size. The max-width property will stop a box being so wide that it is hard to read (lines that are too long are harder to read on screens), and min-width will help prevent boxes being so narrow that they are un readable.</div>
